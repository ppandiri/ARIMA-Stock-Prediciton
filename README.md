# ARIMA-Stock-Prediciton
Within this repository I utilized ARIMA's time series machine learning model to analyze yfinance's S&P500 from 2012 to 2023. 
I utilized this as an experiment to learn about machine learning models and see if my results would be successful.
Since this model was relatively simple the prediction didn't have much variation; however, it still introduced me to some of the concepts of machine learning.
